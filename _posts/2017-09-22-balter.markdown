There is a profundity to touching the cusp of the unknown. 

With a body that works against itself, computers provide a sort of mental refuge. Giving the mind a place to be. To exercise in a space where logic rules.  

If something fails to operate as it should. If there is a malfunction. There is a solution.
More likely, there are a plethora of solutions. Unseen in a tangled mess that the mind must navigate.

It fascinates and challenges.
